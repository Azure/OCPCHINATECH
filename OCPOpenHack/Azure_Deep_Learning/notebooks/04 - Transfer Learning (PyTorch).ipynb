    "# Transfer Learning\n",
    "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification is made up of multiple layers that extract features, such as edges, corners, etc; and then use a final fully-connected layer to classify objects based on these features. You can visualize this like this:\n",

    "*Transfer Learning* is a technique where you can take an existing trained model and re-use its feature extraction layers, replacing its final classification layer with a fully-connected layer trained on your own custom images. With this technique, your model benefits from the feature extraction training that was performed on the base model (which may have been based on a larger training dataset than you have access to) to build a classification model for your own specific set of object classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this help? Well, think of it this way. Suppose you take a professional tennis player and a complete beginner, and try to teach them both how to play raquetball. It's reasonable to assume that the professional tennis player will be easier to train, because many of the underlying skills involved in raquetball are already learned. Similarly, a pre-trained CNN model may be easier to train to classify specific set of objects because it's already learned how to identify the features of common objects, such as edges and corners. Fundamentally, a pre-trained model can be a great way to produce an effective classifier even when you have limited data with which to train it.\n",
