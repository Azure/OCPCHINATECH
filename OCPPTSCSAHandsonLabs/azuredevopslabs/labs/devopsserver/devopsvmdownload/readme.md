We highly recommend that you use the [**Microsoft Hands-on-Labs**](../handsonlabs/) center to run the VM - You do not require a high configuration machine or have to download and setup the machine. Simply access them from a browser of your choice. 

If you prefer to download the VM instead, please see the instructions below.

## Release Notes 2019 (Spring Update)

The 2019 (Spring Update) includes Microsoft Visual Studio DevOps VM and the accompanying hands-on-labs updated to Visual Studio 2019 (16.0.0) and Azure DevOps Server 2019. The virtual machine contains the following pre-configured software:

1. Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Standard Evaluation

2. Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 (16.0.0)

3. Microsoft Azure DevOps Server 2019

4. Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook)

5. Microsoft SQL Server Standard 2017

6. Sample users and data required to support hands-on-lab scripts which accompany this download.

## Downloading the VM

The size of the download is about 30 GB. It is recommended that you use a download manager  like [**Free download manager**](http://www.freedownloadmanager.org/){:target="_blank"} or [**Download Accelerator Plus**](http://www.speedbit.com/dap/){:target="_blank"}.

These utility provide:

* Multiple simultaneous download streams for (usually) a much faster download experience.

* Auto-resume support for interrupted downloads

Using **Free download manager**

- Download and install Free download manager if you currently do not have one installed 
- Open and select all the <a href="./devopsvm2019links.txt" target="_blank">download URLs</a> from the text file. Press ***CTRL+C*** to copy the selected URLs to clipboard.
- Select Menu - ***Paste URLs from clipboard***      
- When the download is complete, double-click the .exe file to self-extract the RAR files to a folder       
- Read the "Working with the â€¦" document to start using the VM

   >There are quite a number of important instructions on how to use the VM including activating the VM, taking snapshots/check points, etc., documented. We highly recommend that you read through the [Working with the Microsoft Visual Studio DevOps (Winter Update) Virtual Machine](../started/) document prior to using the VM, even if you may have used the earlier version of the VM.

   >Note that The VM has about 15 GB of free hard disk space. Should you want to increase the size of the disk, you will need to do so before creating snapshots/check points. You can refer this article on [TechNet](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn282284(v=ws.11).aspx){:target="_blank"} for instructions on expanding the virtual hard disk.
