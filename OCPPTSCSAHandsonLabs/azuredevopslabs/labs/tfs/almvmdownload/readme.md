   >There are quite a number of important instructions on how to use the VM including activating the VM, taking snapshots/check points, etc., documented. We highly recommend that you read through the [Working with the Visual Studio 2017 (Winter Update) ALM Virtual Machine](../started/) document prior to using the VM, even if you may have used the earlier version of the VM.
