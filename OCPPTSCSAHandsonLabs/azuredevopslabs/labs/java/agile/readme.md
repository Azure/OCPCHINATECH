## Managing your team project backlog

In this exercise, you are going to examine the various portfolio planning features of Visual Studio Team Services to group and manage your work and that of your team using backlogs. This exercise assumes you have completed the Exercise 1, and have created a Team Project using the Scrum template with a Git repo.

This exercise uses a team project named **jdev-labs** (if you have chosen a different name for your project, select the project you created in the previous exercise). For this first part, you will create work items for you in the lab. Later, you will create some more work items as you work through the MyShuttle scenario.

1. Login to your VSTS account and navigate to your project

1. Click the **Work** link.

1. On the left, click the **Features** link.

1. In the Title box, enter **Intranet Site Updates** and press Enter.

1. Let us add another feature. In the Title box, enter **Internet Site Updates** and press Enter.

    You now have defined two features.

1. In the **Title** field, enter **Site Fit & Finish**.

    ![image11](images/image11.png)

1. Click **OK**. Visual Studio Team Services opens up the New Product Backlog Item screen. Feel free to add a description.

1. Double-click on the **Site Fit & Finish** Product Backlog Item (PBI) in the list to open up the dialog

1. Change the **State** to **Committed**. Youâ€™ll notice that it is assigned to you automatically because the parent feature was assigned to you.

1. Click the links button on the right of the form.

    ![image9a](images/image9a.png)

1. Click the **Add link** drop down menu and select **New Item** link.

    ![image10](images/image10.png)

1. Change the **Work item type** field to **Task** and make sure the **Link type** is set to **Child**.

1. In the **Title** field, enter **Add master branding**. Click **OK** when ready.

1. Feel free to explore a bit, add a description if you like and then click **Save and close** to finish using the Task dialog.

1. Back at the PBI screen, Click **Save and close** to close the Product Backlog Item.

1. Click the small triangle to the left of the **Site Fit & Finish** PBI.

    ![image14](images/image14.png)

    You can now see all the child tasks associated with the PBI.

    ![image15](images/image15.png)

    You can also see parent items (in this case, Features).

1. On the command bar above the backlog, click the Hide link to the right of the Parents label to display the parent Features.

    ![image16](images/image16.png)

    You now can see the parent Features.

    ![image17](images/image17.png)

1. Under the Backlog items title, click the Board link.

     ![image18](images/image18.png)

1. In the Committed column, on the **Site Fit & Finish** card, click the ![image19](images/image19.png) item.

    ![image20](images/image20.png)

    You can see the child task here.

1. Click the **+ Add task** item.

1. In the open text area, type **Add master navigation to menu page** and press Enter.

    ![image21](images/image21.png)

    You can see all of your work for the active sprint by accessing the **Task Board**.

1. On the left, click **Sprint 1** under **Current**.

    ![image22](images/image22.png)

    Now you can see your work for just the current sprint.

    ![image23](images/image23.png)

    You need to assign the **Add master navigation to menu page** Task to you.

1. Move your mouse and hover over the card and you will get a combo-box that opens up.

    ![image24](images/image24.png)

1. Assign the task to yourself. One more thing you need to do is to add an estimate for each work item.

1. In the task board, mouse-over at the bottom right corner of the task card and enter the value **1**. This is the **Remaining Work** field. You can also open the work item and then update the **Remaining Work** field value and save the changes. Repeat this for the other task in the task board.

    ![image25](images/image25.png)

    Now you want to indicate that you have started working.

1. Drag and drop the **Add Master Branding** work item to the **In progress** column.

    ![image26](images/image26.png)

1. In the upper right corner of the Task board, click the **Settings** icon

    ![image27](images/image27.png)

    This opens the Settings dialog where you can make adjustments to many features of the Work Hub including the Task board.

1. For **Task**, check the **Show ID** checkbox to display the work item ID on the cards.

    ![image28](images/image28.png)

1. Click **Save and Close** when done.

    Now you will be able to see the Work Item ID easily when you look at the Task board. You will use the IDs later when you commit code to your Git repo in the next exercise.

This is a quick introduction to the Agile Planning tools and Work Items. You will work with them again later.
