    "**Note**: Data pre-processing is often the most time-consuming part of a machine learning project. When working with image data, there are many ways in which the data can be enhanced for use in machine learning, for example by scaling the images to be a consistent size and shape,  adjusting contrast to correct for over/under-exposure, or cropping to include only the most relevant visual elements. Most modern machine learning frameworks include functions to perform these tasks, but a professional data scientist working in computer vision scenarios will benefit from having knowledge of how to work with images using common Python libraries."
